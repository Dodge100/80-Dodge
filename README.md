# Dodge80
A high-quality, low cost 80% keyboard.

The goal of this keyboard was to be more lightweight while still maintaining ergonomics. This led to me using the Kalih Choc V2 Low Profile Reds as well as a column-staggered ortholinear layout. To help increase battery life, I chose to use nice!nanos (cheaper alternatives like an stm32 could be used) as well as foregoing LEDs. Note: An Oled could have been very easy to use, however, I didn't see the point as when typing, you wouldn't be looking at the keys anyway.
