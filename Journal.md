Documents my progress designing the 80% Dodge.

Made layout by looking at similarly designed dished keyboards to see how I could replicate that effect in a non-dished keyboard. I wanted to ensure that this would be relatively comfortable so I made sure to print out the layout on paper to see how it felt based on my hand and how I type. I liked the addition of the thumb cluster as I felt it allowed for better use of it since I don't normally use my thumb for modifier keys.

Began routing the PCB for the left hand. Will likely join the 2 and cut them later to save on assembly costs.
